What's up: Did not try implementing.Noticed every observation needed but couldn’t come up with an entire solution.Didn’t think that we could simply use prefix sum to check for parity (if even skip, else if odd, just swap with its pair element)Could also be solved using treaps.
Key Takeaway: I seriously don’t know what to write here :’(
